### **Gradient Descent Step-by-Step (Part 1)**  
**Description:**  
This notebook provides a step-by-step implementation of the **Gradient Descent algorithm**, focusing on using loops to iteratively update model parameters. It is designed to help beginners understand how gradient descent works at a fundamental level before moving on to more optimized approaches.  

Key highlights of this notebook:  
- A basic introduction to **Gradient Descent** and its importance in optimization.  
- Implementation of gradient descent using loops for better clarity and understanding.  
- Visualizations and mathematical explanations to show how parameters update over iterations.  
- A hands-on approach for learning through **Python and NumPy**.  

This notebook is ideal for those who are new to machine learning and want to build a solid foundation in **optimization techniques** before implementing more advanced models.

### **Gradient Descent Step-by-Step (Part 2)**  
**Description:**  
This second part of the **Gradient Descent Step-by-Step** series takes a deeper dive into the optimization process by introducing a **self-designed algorithm**. Instead of using a conventional gradient descent implementation, this notebook explores a custom approach to updating weights, potentially improving efficiency or addressing specific limitations of standard gradient descent.  

Key highlights of this notebook:  
- A refined or **customized approach** to gradient descent, named **SELF ALGORITHM**.  
- A comparison with the standard gradient descent approach to highlight improvements or differences.  
- Further insights into learning rate adjustments, convergence speed, and optimization techniques.  
- Python implementation with **practical examples and visualizations** for better understanding.  

This notebook is great for those who already understand the basics of gradient descent and want to explore different variations or **custom optimizations** to improve machine learning model performance.
